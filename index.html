        <h1>About Me:</h1>
        <p>My name is Johan Edvardsson. I'm 22 years old and I live in a small town
        outside of Gothenburg. My favourite season of the year is Winter because I
        enjoy the cold and dark, it's cozy!

        <p>
        The most important part of my daily life must be music. I listen to music
        almost from the moment I wake up to when I go to bed. While I'm not
        listening to music I'm either thinking about it or playing it myself on my
        7 string guitar! I mostly listen to heavy metal and all of its subgenres
        but I enjoy most types of music.

      In my free time I enjoy playing online games. I keep in touch with and
      hang out with a lot of my friends this way. The genres I enjoy the most
      are competetive games, both FPS games and MOBA games, as well as MMORPG
      games. Most of my time playing games currently I spend on either World of
      Warcraft, DotA 2 or CS2.

    <span class="content-box-text">
    <p>
      I greatly enjoy cooking. Especially if its for a guest or a family member.
      My favourite aspect of cooking is the fact that you're taking multiple
      ingredients, which can be quite dull on their own, and mixing them all
      together to create something unique, tasteful and enjoyable. While cooking
      I try to be open minded and explorative, often trying recipies I've never
      had before as well as often trying to move outside of my comfort zone.
